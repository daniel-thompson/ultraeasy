Main tool
---------

For build instructions see INSTALL.

Usage: ultraeasy [OPTION]...
Extract and display data from a OneTouch UltraEasy blood glucose
monitor.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
  -c, --csv                  extract meter readings in CSV format
  -D, --device=DEVICE        choose a serial device (default: /dev/ttyUSB0)
  -d, --dump                 show meter readings in plain text
  -h, --help                 show this help text and exit
  -t, --meter-time           show the meter's clock (time and date)
  -s, --meter-serial         show the meter's serial number
  -r, --meter-version        show the meter's version information
  -R, --raw                  show raw meter readings in hex format
  -V, --verbose              increase the level of internal logging
                             (can be supplied several times)
  -v, --version              output version information and exit


Scripts
-------

The scripts/ directory contains some additional tools that interoperate with
the main tool.

The role to the scripts is to archive (and merge) the output of the main tool
into a "ASCII database" of readings.

Examples:
  ultraeasy --dump | ue-dbupdate
  ue-dbdump | ue-db2sheet > converted.csv


Building
--------

From a distributed package the build process is the standard GNU autotools
approach:

  ./configure
  make
  make check
  make install

If you obtained this program via git you must generate the configure script
and Makefile templates first:

  autoreconf -i


Testing
-------

This program includes a built in facade (fake meter) for testing
purposes. It can be activated using --driver=facade. The build system
includes the command "make check" which will run a simple test suite
using the fake mater as a target. It is strongly recommended that this
test suite be run whenever the program is recompiled.

The low level hardware communications parts of the driver, which cannot
be tested using the facade were tested by comparing the output of the 
program with the readings actual meters displayed on their LCDs. Tests 
were performed on three different meters.  All three where UK versions 
of the meter and, between them, were running two different versions of 
the firmware.
